- ~~[] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st~~
---

## Day 0: March 6, 2025

I did some preliminary research. I think building a printer without my own printer would be a cool challenge. I'll try to use entirely off-the-shelf parts, but maybe I'll have to break my promise and order a few (especially if it's on HC's dime lol).

I did some research on the RepRap site, and there are some pre-existing bootstrap designs. One question I'll have to answer is delta or cartesian -- cartesian printers are definitely more common, but there are benefits to delta designs. I'll have to look into it.

I'm most concerned about building an extruder -- I'm not really sure where to start with that, especially given my lack of electronics experience, and have researched it a bit. I have some more ideas that I'll commit to paper soon. Looking forward to this. It promises to be interesting at the very least.

## Day 1: March 9, 2025

I did a lot more research, especially on delta printers. I have now decided to go with a cartesian or core xy build. I spent a bit browsing repraps and repstraps, and it seems like these are simpler and more robust designs for non-3D printed builds. I'm planning to use some kind of extrusion for the frame. 

I also read a bit about firmware, but that's a later problem. The [Orbiter](https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/) and [Sherpa](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) seem like my best bets for extrusion.
